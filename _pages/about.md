I am a fourth-year PhD student in computer science and enginering at the University of Notre Dame, advised by [Walter Scheirer](https://www.wjscheirer.com).

My research areas fall within human-computer interaction (HCI) and technology ethics. I am interested in how the designs of technologies encourage or discourage us from taking actions that lead to a good life, and how we can redesign technology to promote positive habits.

I believe in the value of drawing from the time-tested wisdom of our traditions to help determine which habits we should be designing for or avoiding. So far, my research has relied on virtue ethics and Catholic Social Teaching to inform such designs. On this topic, I co-authored the book [*Virtue in Virtual Spaces: Catholic Social Teaching and Technology*](https://litpress.org/Products/00269/Virtue-in-Virtual-Spaces) with Megan Levis and Walter Scheirer.

I received an Sc.B. in computer science from Brown University in 2017. Before starting my graduate work at Notre Dame in 2021, I worked as a software engineer for Amazon Alexa and served as a campus missionary with [FOCUS](https://focus.org). Both of these experiences influenced the trajectory of my research today. (Check out [this article](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/catholic-social-teaching-as-an-alternative-to-both-luddism-and-techno-optimism/) to learn how they did so!)


Personal
======
Outside of the lab, I sing sacred music with the [Notre Dame Magnificat Choir](https://www.youtube.com/@notredamemagnificatchoir). Taylor Swift and Gregorian chant are two of my favorite kinds of music to listen to. I grew up in Tokyo and love practicing my Japanese (though recently, "practicing" has been limited to Duolingo and watching Japanese videos). I used to be a runner, but barre has become my preferred workout since starting my PhD. I love to travel and explore new places, and I'm grateful to have traveled to London, Mumbai, Hawaii, Mexico City, and Guadalajara because of my graduate studies.
